# artifacts-keyring

**Note:** This tool is currently in public preview.

The `artifacts-keyring` package provides authentication for publishing or consuming Python packages to or from Azure Artifacts feeds within [Azure DevOps](https://azure.com/devops).

This package is an extension to [keyring](https://pypi.org/project/keyring), which will automatically find and use it once installed.

Both [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip) and [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine) will use `keyring` to
find credentials.

## Installation

To install this package, run the following `pip` command:

```
pip install artifacts-keyring
```

## Usage

### Requirements

To use `artifacts-keyring` to set up authentication between `pip`/`twine` and Azure Artifacts, the following requirements must be met:

* pip version **19.2** or higher
* twine version **1.13.0** or higher

### Publishing packages to an Azure Artifacts feed
Once `artifacts-keyring` is installed, to publish a package, use the following `twine` command, replacing **<org_name>** and **<feed_name>** with your own:

```
twine upload --repository-url https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<org_name>/_packaging/<feed_name>/pypi/upload <package_wheel_or_other_dist_format>
```

### Installing packages from an Azure Artifacts feed
Once `artifacts-keyring` is installed, to consume a package, use the following `pip` command, replacing **<org_name>** and **<feed_name>** with your own, and **<package_name>** with the package you want to install:

```
pip install <package_name> --index-url https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<org_name>/_packaging/<feed_name>/pypi/simple
```

## Advanced configuration
The `artifacts-keyring` package is layered on top of our [Azure Artifacts Credential Provider](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider). Check out that link to the GitHub repo for more information on configuration options.

### Environment variables

- `ARTIFACTS_KEYRING_NONINTERACTIVE_MODE`: Controls whether the underlying credential provider can issue interactive prompts.
